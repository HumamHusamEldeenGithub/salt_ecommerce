                  Welcome to Salt, your ultimate destination for chic and
                  coastal-inspired fashion. At Salt, we're passionate about
                  combining the laid-back vibe of coastal living with the latest
                  trends in clothing to bring you a unique and effortless style.
                  Our story begins with a love for the sea and a vision to
                  create a brand that celebrates the carefree spirit of coastal
                  living. Inspired by the sun-kissed beaches, the salty breeze,
                  and the relaxed atmosphere of seaside towns, we've curated a
                  collection of clothing that embodies the essence of coastal
                  chic. From breezy sundresses and flowy tops to stylish
                  swimwear and beach accessories, our carefully curated
                  selection is designed to evoke the feeling of a seaside escape
                  wherever you go. Whether you're strolling along the boardwalk,
                  lounging on the beach, or exploring a coastal town, Salt has
                  you covered with the perfect outfit for every occasion.
